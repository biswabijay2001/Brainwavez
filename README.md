# Brainwavez
BrainWavez is a machine learning model that utilizes a 32-channel electroencephalography (EEG) machine to monitor the electrical brain activity of human beings for the prediction of stress. The goal of the project is to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and cost effective way to measure the stress.
