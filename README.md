Stress is a common problem in todayâ€™s fast-paced lifestyle leading to various health related issues. Detecting stress is important for timely intervention and prevention of serious health issues. 
Working memory is a cognitive system that is responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information needed for complex cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving, reasoning, and language comprehension. It allows us to keep important information in our mind and work with it, without being distracted by irrelevant information. 
The goal of the project is to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and cost effective way to measure the stress and to see how the effective working memory is being affected due to the stress by using the web application which we have specifically designed for this purpose.
